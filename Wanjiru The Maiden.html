<h1>Wanjiru The Maiden</h1>
<p>The sun blazed upon the earth; there was no rain. <br />
 <br />
The crops died and hunger was manifest among the people.<br />
 <br />
This happened one year, again the next, and then for a third year.<br />
 <br />
So the people gathered at the praying place, and asked of each other the reason for their plight; then the question was posed to the Medicine-Man.<br />
 <br />
He spilled his gourd of its contents, upon the ground again and again.</p>

<p>Then he declared that the rains would come only when the maiden Wanjiru was bought.</p>

<p>He told them that each, from the youngest lad to the oldest man, must bring, on the appointed day, a goat to purchase Wanjiru from her family.<br />
 <br />
The day arrived, and all the people were present, with each man leading a goat.</p>

<p>The people gathered in a circle, and the relations of Wanjiru stood together, and she herself stood in the middle.</p>

<p>As they stood there, Wanjiru began to sink into the ground.<br />
 <br />
Soon she was in up to her knees. She cried, &quot;I am lost!&quot; The people pressed close and placed goats in the keeping of Wanjiru's parents.</p>

<p>She sank lower to her waist. Again she cried out, &quot;I am lost but much rain will fall!&quot; More goats were thrust upon her family.</p>

<p>She sank to her breast, and still no rain came. Wanjiru cried out another time, &quot;A great rain will come!&quot;</p>

<p>Now she sank to her neck, and then the rain poured down.</p>

<p>The people should have come forward to save her, but instead they placed more goats upon the family. <br />
 <br />
Then Wanjiru said, &quot;My people have undone me&quot;, and she sank down to her eyes.</p>

<p>As one or another of her family moved toward her to save her, another of the people would present him or her with a goat and that family member would step back. <br />
 <br />
Wanjiru cried out for the last time, &quot;My own family has undone me!&quot; Then she sank from sight.</p>

<p>The rain poured down in a great deluge and the people hurried for shelter in their homes.</p>

<p>There was a young warrior who lamented the loss of Wanjiru.</p>

<p>He swore to find her and bring her back. He wandered for a long time, and eventually returned to the spot where Wanjiru had disappeared. <br />
 <br />
Here as he stood where she had stood, he slowly began to sink into the ground; and he sank lower and lower until the ground closed over him.<br />
 <br />
He found himself on a road beneath the ground, and as he trod down the road he came upon Wanjiru, all muddy and dishevelled, and without her clothing which had disintegrated.</p>

<p>He picked her up and carried her upon his back to where they had sunk beneath the ground. <br />
 <br />
Here they rose up together into the open air.</p>

<p>He took her to his mother's house, where she was fed the fat from slaughtered goats and clothed with their skins, until she, again, was beautiful and well-dressed. <br />
 <br />
It came to pass that the village was having a dance, and she and her warrior attended.<br />
 <br />
When her family saw her, they attempted to approach her, but her lover beat them off. <br />
 <br />
When her family made repeated attempts to see her over the course of the next few days, the warrior repented.<br />
 <br />
He paid the family the purchase price (labola) and allowed them to reconcile.</p>
